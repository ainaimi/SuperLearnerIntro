# SuperLearner Intro

This is the example code for a paper entitled "Stacked Generalization: An Introduction to SuperLearning" by Ashley I Naimi and Laura B Balzer.

The repository includes the following:

* A program to reproduce the dose-response analysis
* A GAM wrapper program that is sourced by the dose-response analysis program
* A program to reproduce the event prediction analysis

These three programs should be downloaded from GitHub onto a local computer to run. In both the dose response and event prediction programs, the "setwd()" line should be changed to the location on the local computer in which the files were downloaded.
